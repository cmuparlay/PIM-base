# PIM-base

This submodule contains efficient low-level function calls we implemented, including efficient CPU-DPU communication, pipelining, performance stats collection, database correctness testing, argument parsing, random distribution generators and other miscs.

## Requirements

This implementation was created to facilitate the experiments in the paper. The current implementation can only run on [UPMEM](https://www.upmem.com/) machines. This codeset is built on [UPMEM SDK](https://sdk.upmem.com/).
